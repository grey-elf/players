# Introduction to the World of Greyhawk

> *On **Oerth** (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and archmagi, rife with adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish realm in the north, threatening all civilization.*

*The World of Greyhawk* is either the first or second campaign setting for the D&D game, depending on how you count. It is a darker and grittier setting, where heroes are more often motivated by their own self-interest than by thoughts of altruism. Magic is fading from the world, and those able to wield it are largely seen as power-hungry or corrupt, usually rightly so.  

!!! note "Terminology and Names"
    While out of fiction *Greyhawk* or *World of Greyhawk* are used as the name of the setting, in-fiction "Greyhawk" refers only to the *Free City of Greyhawk*, the nearby *Castle Greyhawk*, or the surrounding *Domain of Greyhawk*. All important, but only a part of the greater setting. Greyhawk's world is named *Oerth*, on which is found the focus of the setting: the *Flanaess*, a region of the continent of *Oerik*.

The early history of the Flanaess is one of waves of migrations. Various human and non-human groups spread into the region, displacing and melding with each other over the years. Many of these waves of migration were driven by the Baklunish-Suloise Wars, while more followed the mutual destruction of the Baklunish Empire and Suel Imperium in the Twin Cataclysms that culminated the Wars.  

Little of the Flanaess remains unclaimed. The map is crisscrossed by the borders of various nations or kingdoms that vie for control of their own piece of it. Some alliances hold strong, while others come and go. Even those claiming to be united as forces of good may fail to agree on what "good" means. 

The adventure begins in late 581 CY, and unbeknownst to the people inhabiting it, there are dark days ahead for the Flanaess. Recently freed from his imprisonment beneath the Castle Greyhawk, the dread Iuz gathers strength in the North. Tensions are mounting. The coming years will see war sweep across the Flanaess, and a grave betrayal will shatter one of its most powerful organizations.  

## Recommended Reading

Be careful when reading up for additional information on the setting, many later sources contain spoilers for some of the major events of this adventure.  

Most recommended for a general overview is the 1983 *World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting*, also known as some variation of "the boxed set". It provides an adequate overview of the setting at an appropriate time for this adventure. More information on the Free City of Greyhawk itself can be found in the 1989 *The City of Greyhawk* boxed set.  

If a very specific point to start from is required (say for a character origin) consider the 5th edition module *Ghosts of Saltmarsh*.  

Any additional sources should be checked with the DM if spoilers are a concern.
