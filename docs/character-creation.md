*High Elf* includes high elves, grey elves, valley elves, and snow elves.  
*Wood Elf* includes wood elves, and wild elves (grugach).  
*Dark Elf* and *Sea Elf* can be taken as they are.  

## 2. Choose a Class
All classes from the basic rules are allowed. Statements on subclasses are with the source restriction in mind.  

### Barbarian
Barbarians commonly come from the North, most from the kingdoms of the Frost, Ice, or Snow Barbarians. Others may come from the Tiger or Wolf Nomads, or the Rovers of the Barrens, among others.  

Any barbarian subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Bard
Bards of any kind may be found in most places in the Flanaess.  

Any bard subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Cleric
Clerics of all sorts inhabit the Flanaess, following one or more gods of the world's many pantheons. Some such gods may be found on the table below. Non-human deities are as normal.  

Any cleric subclass may be found on Oerth.

### Druid
Druids of the Flanaess, along with many others who live close to nature, are adherents of the Old Faith. The Old Faith venerates Nature as a primal force, alongside Beory, the Oerth Mother, and in many cases Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.  

Any druid subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Fighter
The Flanaess is crawling with fighters of all kinds.  

A *Purple Dragon Knight* is instead a Knight of the Watch, a near-monastic order of knights charged with the protection of Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, and Keoland from Baklunish incursions.  

Any fighter subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Monk
Monks are quite rare on Oerth, except among the sinister order known as the Scarlet Brotherhood, who hold the secret techniques of the *Way of the Long Death*.  
There also exists a recently-founded order of monks (as well as rogues and psionicists) who stand in opposition to the Scarlet Brotherhood, known as the Splintered Mind.  
Monks who worship Pholtus, Pelor, or Al’Akbar might follow the *Way of the Sun Soul*.  

Any monk subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Paladin
Many paladins exist in the Flanaess, some as part of purely military orders and others of religious ones.  

A great many paladins worship Heironeous, the Archpaladin. Paladins the Church of Heironeous, such as the Order of the Chalice, are often sworn to the *Oath of Devotion*, and stand in opposition to paladins of Hextor, many of whom are sworn to the *Oath of Conquest*.  
Paladins sworn to the *Oath of the Crown* may be members of the Knights of the Hart, or be associated with the Great Kingdom.  
Those associated with the Old Faith may become paladins sworn to the *Oath of the Ancients*.  
The Lords of the Gloaming, an elite knightly order within the Church of Pholtus, might be sworn to the *Oath of the Watchers*.  
Some paladins, known as "Avengers of Trithereon" are sworn to the *Oath of Vengeance*, and are members of orders such as the Friends of the Falcon (the Harrusians), the Brothers of Ca'rolk, or the Sons of Nemoud.  
Most paladins among the Holy Knights of Rao are sworn to the *Oath of Redemption* and are known as Envoys or Heralds.  

Any paladin subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Ranger
Rangers may be found in many places across the Flanaess. Some operate on their own, while others might be part of military or militia organizations such as the Border Rangers of Perrenland. Yet others are affiliated with groups not sworn to any one nation, like the famed Rangers of the Gnarley, or the rangers' school of Stalwart Pines.  
Most rangers at least pay homage to the Old Faith.  

Any ranger subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Rogue
Rogues are exceptionally common across the Flanaess. The City of Greyhawk is known as the City of Thieves for good reason, and its thieves' guild's reach extends even far abroad.  

Many rogues who would count themselves as a *Thief* or *Mastermind* could be found in Greyhawk's thieves' guild, and in a city with so much crime there is always need for those of an *Inquisitive* persuasion.  
An *Assassin* would have no shortage of work from conspiring nobles, as well as many other shadowy groups, and a *Scout* could be counted as a member of many of the same organizations that rangers might be a part of.  
There are many places where a *Swashbuckler* might come from, but they are especially common among the Rhennee, the river nomads of the Flanaess.  

Any rogue subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Sorcerer
Even with magic disappearing from Oerth, there are those rare individuals born or imbued with an innate arcane spark.  

Someone who came across a mysterious site within the Barrier Peaks, or the magics of ancient Blackmoor, may become a *Clockwork Soul*.  
*Storm Sorcery* might be practiced among seafaring cultures such as the Frost, Ice, or Snow Barbarians in the North, the Dominion of the Sea Barons in the East, the Hold of the Sea Princes in the South, or the Rhennee nomads on the rivers of the Flanaess.  
Sites of powerful arcane energies, such as those remaining in the aftermath of the Twin Cataclysms, could empower a sorcerer with *Wild Magic*.  

Any sorcerer subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Warlock
While warlocks are uncommon on Oerth, there are many entities in the history of the Flanaess that those who dare seek their power could make deals with.  

Warlocks of the *Undying* might have pacts with entities such as the Old One, Iuz; Iggwilv, the Witch Queen of Perrenland; or Azal'Lan, the lost wizard-king of Knurl.  
Of the many demon lords, there are a few who have been especially involved in the history of the Flanaess, including  Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception, who was imprisoned below Castle Greyhawk for centuries; Graz'zt, the Dark Prince, who has a tenuous relationship with Iggwilv, with whom he sired Iuz; and Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, was one of the architects of the Temple of Elemental Evil, along with her ally and lover Iuz. The archdevils have had less direct involvement in the affairs of Oerth but some, notably the pit fiend ministers of the Dark Eight, have still been known to make deals with mortals. Any of them might be a patron for a warlock of the *Fiend*.  
The Dark God, Tharizdun, might be the patron of a warlock of the *Great Old One*.  

Any warlock subclass may be found on Oerth.  

### Wizard
The wizards of Oerth are few but mighty, determined to either counter or take advantage of the disappearance of magic from the world.  

While the legendary archwizards of the Circle of Eight might be the best known, hundreds of wizards (and arcane spellcasters of other types) are counted as members of the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry.  

Any wizard subclass may be found on Oerth.

## 4. Describe Your Character

### Languages

There are five major languages used across the Flanaess. These are:  

- Suloise
- Flan
- Ancient Baklunish
- Old Oeridian
- Common

Any time you are able to learn a language of your choice, these are available as additional choices.  

There are also some notable regional or cultural dialects of these languages, including:  

- Nyrondese (Common)
- The Cold Tongue (Suloise)
- Velondi (Old Oeridian)
- Keolandish (Old Oeridian)
- Lendorian (Suloise)

These dialects can only be learned if they are granted by the background regions table.  

Someone who knows only one of a pair of parent language and dialect may make checks requiring knowledge of the other at disadvantage.  
For example, a character who knows Suloise attempting to convince someone who only knows the Cold Tongue could make a Charisma (Persuasion) check at disadvantage, or a character who know Keolandish attempting to discover something in a book written in Old Oeridian could make an Intelligence (Investigation) check at disadvantage.  

One additional language of note is Rhopan, the language of the Rhennee. It is an amalgam of many languages, none of them from Oerth, and has some overlap with Thieves' Cant. Only Rhennee characters may learn this language.  

### Background Regions

There are many distinct regions of the Flanaess that a character may come from. This isn't necessarily their place of birth, it could be where they grew up, studied, trained, worked, or otherwise spent a meaningful amount of time.  

You may roll 1d100 on the appropriate column or choose a region from the below table to determine your character's background region. If there is one, you may learn the noted Extra Language.  
Since the Rhennee are nomadic and rarely stay in any one place for long, Rhennee characters can still roll for or pick a region if they wish, but instead of any Extra Language that might be listed, they may learn Rhopan.

### Further Details

You may use details here and on the [setting overview](setting.md) to establish your character's place in the world.  

The class details tables and "This is Your Life" section in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* can offer more depth to your character.  

## 5. Choose Equipment

Take equipment as normal. Roll for a trinket if you would like to.  

## 6. Come Together

Once your character is ready, level up twice. All characters will begin the adventure at third level.  

Answer the following questions to help ground your character in the campaign. You may decide how many, if any, details of your answers to share with players other than the DM:  

- Why have you come to the City of Greyhawk?
- What would you kill to know?
- Who have you wronged?

Each character is a contact of one member of the Circle of Eight, which of the wizards they each know will be determined in the first session. The members of the party are all acquainted at least through these mutual connections, though you may determine other reasons for them to know each other as well. What association you have with the archmage is up to you. You might be an apprentice or research assistant, a supplier, an informant, a bodyguard, a courier, or even just a friend or confidant. The choice is yours
