Most limitations are open to discussion. D&D Beyond Character Builder Settings Sources: All disabled. Core D&D content only. Exceptions may be made for UA and homebrew content with DM discussion. Optional Features: All allowed. Advancement Type: Milestone. 1. Choose a Race Customizing Your Origin is allowed. Custom Lineage will require discussion with the DM. In addition to the ones from disallowed sources, the following character race options are not allowed: Gith (MToF) Verdan (AI) The following character race options are especially rare, but not unheard of, in Greyhawk: Aarakocra Aasimar Dragonborn Genasi Tabaxi Tiefling The following character race options are typically, but not always, associated with Iuz: Bugbear Goblin Hobgoblin Kobold Orc Elves Shadar-Kai and Eladrin are not found on Oerth at this time. High Elf includes high elves, grey elves, valley elves, and snow elves. Wood Elf includes wood elves, and wild elves (grugach). Dark Elf and Sea Elf can be taken as they are. 2. Choose a Class All classes from the basic rules are allowed. Statements on subclasses are with the source restriction in mind. Barbarian Barbarians commonly come from the North, most from the kingdoms of the Frost, Ice, or Snow Barbarians. Others may come from the Tiger or Wolf Nomads, or the Rovers of the Barrens, among others. Any barbarian subclass may be found on Oerth. Bard Bards of any kind may be found in most places in the Flanaess. Any bard subclass may be found on Oerth. Cleric Clerics of all sorts inhabit the Flanaess, following one or more gods of the world's many pantheons. Some such gods may be found on the table below. Non-human deities are as normal. Any cleric subclass may be found on Oerth. World of Greyhawk Deities Deity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol Beory, goddess of nature N Nature Green disk Boccob, god of magic N Arcana, Knowledge Eye within a pentagram Celestian, god of stars and wanderers N Knowledge, Twilight Arc of seven stars inside a circle Ehlonna, goddess of woodlands NG Life, Nature Unicorn horn Erythnul, god of envy and slaughter CE War Blood drop Fharlanghn, god of horizons and travel NG Knowledge, Trickery Circle crossed by a curved horizon line Heironeous, god of chivalry and valor LG War Lightning bolt Hextor, god of war and discord LE War Six arrows facing downward in a fan Kord, god of athletics and sport CG Tempest, War Four spears and four maces radiating out from a central point Incabulos, god of plague and famine NE Death Reptilian eye with a horizontal diamond Istus, goddess of fate and destiny N Knowledge Weaver\u2019s spindle with three strands Iuz, god of pain and oppression CE Death Grinning human skull Nerull, god of death NE Death Skull with either a sickle or a scythe Obad-Hai, god of nature N Nature Oak leaf and acorn Olidammara, god of revelry CN Trickery Laughing mask Pelor, god of the sun and healing NG Life, Light Sun Pholtus, god of light and law LG Light, Order Silver sun or full moon partially eclipsed by a smaller crescent moon Ralishaz, god of ill luck and insanity CN Trickery Three bone fate-casting sticks Rao, god of peace and reason LG Knowledge, Peace White heart St. Cuthbert, god of common sense and zeal LN Knowledge Circle at the center of a starburst of lines Tharizdun, god of eternal darkness CE Trickery Dark spiral or inverted ziggurat Trithereon, god of liberty and retribution CG War Triskelion Ulaa, goddess of hills and mountains LG Life, War Mountain with a circle at its heart Wee Jas, goddess of magic and death LN Arcana, Death, Grave, Knowledge, Order Red skull in front of fireball Druid Druids of the Flanaess, along with many others who live close to nature, are adherents of the Old Faith. The Old Faith venerates Nature as a primal force, alongside Beory, the Oerth Mother, and in many cases Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa. Any druid subclass may be found on Oerth. Fighter The Flanaess is crawling with fighters of all kinds. A Purple Dragon Knight is instead a Knight of the Watch, a near-monastic order of knights charged with the protection of Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, and Keoland from Baklunish incursions. Any fighter subclass may be found on Oerth. Monk Monks are quite rare on Oerth, except among the sinister order known as the Scarlet Brotherhood, who hold the secret techniques of the Way of the Long Death . There also exists a recently-founded order of monks (as well as rogues and psionicists) who stand in opposition to the Scarlet Brotherhood, known as the Splintered Mind. Monks who worship Pholtus, Pelor, or Al\u2019Akbar might follow the Way of the Sun Soul . Any monk subclass may be found on Oerth. Paladin Many paladins exist in the Flanaess, some as part of purely military orders and others of religious ones. A great many paladins worship Heironeous, the Archpaladin. Paladins the Church of Heironeous, such as the Order of the Chalice, are often sworn to the Oath of Devotion , and stand in opposition to paladins of Hextor, many of whom are sworn to the Oath of Conquest . Paladins sworn to the Oath of the Crown may be members of the Knights of the Hart, or be associated with the Great Kingdom. Those associated with the Old Faith may become paladins sworn to the Oath of the Ancients . The Lords of the Gloaming, an elite knightly order within the Church of Pholtus, might be sworn to the Oath of the Watchers . Some paladins, known as \"Avengers of Trithereon\" are sworn to the Oath of Vengeance , and are members of orders such as the Friends of the Falcon (the Harrusians), the Brothers of Ca'rolk, or the Sons of Nemoud. Most paladins, known as Envoys or Heralds, among the Holy Knights of Rao are sworn to the Oath of Redemption . Any paladin subclass may be found on Oerth. Ranger Rangers may be found in many places across the Flanaess. Some operate on their own, while others might be part of military or militia organizations such as the Border Rangers of Perrenland. Yet others are affiliated with groups not sworn to any one nation, like the famed Rangers of the Gnarley, or the rangers' school of Stalwart Pines. Most rangers at least pay homage to the Old Faith. Any ranger subclass may be found on Oerth. Rogue Rogues are exceptionally common across the Flanaess. The City of Greyhawk is known as the City of Thieves for good reason, and its thieves' guild's reach extends even far abroad. Many a rogue who would count themself as a Thief or Mastermind could be found in Greyhawk's thieves' guild, and in a city with so much crime there is always need for those of an Inquisitive persuasion. An Assassin would have no shortage of work from conspiring nobles, as well as many other shadowy groups, and a Scout could be counted as a member of many of the same organizations that rangers might be a part of. There are many places where a Swashbuckler might come from, but they are especially common among the Rhennee, the river nomads of the Flanaess. Any rogue subclass may be found on Oerth. Sorcerer Even with magic disappearing from Oerth, there are those rare individuals born or imbued with an innate arcane spark. Someone who came across a mysterious site within the Barrier Peaks, or the magics of ancient Blackmoor, may become a Clockwork Soul . Storm Sorcery might be practiced among seafaring cultures such as the Frost, Ice, or Snow Barbarians in the North, the Dominion of the Sea Barons in the East, the Hold of the Sea Princes in the South, or the Rhennee nomads on the rivers of the Flanaess. Sites of powerful arcane energies, such as those remaining in the aftermath of the Twin Cataclysms, could empower a sorcerer with Wild Magic . Any sorcerer subclass may be found on Oerth. Warlock While warlocks are uncommon on Oerth, there are many entities in the history of the Flanaess that those who dare seek their power could make deals with. Warlocks of the Undying might have pacts with entities such as the Old One, Iuz; Iggwilv, the Witch Queen of Perrenland; or Azal'Lan, the lost wizard-king of Knurl. Of the many demon lords, there are a few who have been especially involved in the history of the Flanaess, including Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception, who was imprisoned below Castle Greyhawk for centuries; Graz'zt, the Dark Prince, who has a tenuous relationship with Iggwilv, with whom he sired Iuz; and Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, was one of the architects of the Temple of Elemental Evil, along with her ally and lover Iuz. The archdevils have had less direct involvement in the affairs of Oerth but some, notably the pit fiend ministers of the Dark Eight, have still been known to make deals with mortals. Any of them might be a patron for a warlock of the Fiend . The Dark God, Tharizdun, might be the patron of a warlock of the Great Old One . Any warlock subclass may be found on Oerth. Wizard The wizards of Oerth are few but mighty, determined to either counter or take advantage of the disappearance of magic from the world. While the legendary archwizards of the Circle of Eight might be the best known, hundreds of wizards (and arcane spellcasters of other types) are counted as members of the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry. Any wizard subclass may be found on Oerth. 3. Determine Ability Scores 4d6 drop lowest or standard array. 4. Describe Your Character Languages There are five major languages used across the Flanaess. These are: Suloise Flan Ancient Baklunish Old Oeridian Common Any time you are able to learn a language of your choice, these are available as additional choices. There are also some notable regional or cultural dialects of these languages, including: Nyrondese (Common) The Cold Tongue (Suloise) Velondi (Old Oeridian) Keolandish (Old Oeridian) Lendorian (Suloise) These dialects can only be learned if they are granted by the background regions table. Someone who knows only one of a pair of parent language and dialect may make checks requiring knowledge of the other at disadvantage. For example, a character who knows Suloise attempting to convince someone who only knows the Cold Tongue could make a Charisma (Persuasion) check at disadvantage, or a character who know Keolandish attempting to discover something in a book written in Old Oeridian could make an Intelligence (Investigation) check at disadvantage. One additional language of note is Rhopan, the language of the Rhennee. It is an amalgam of many languages, none of them from Oerth, and has some overlap with Thieves' Cant. Only Rhennee characters may learn this language. Background Regions There are many distinct regions of the Flanaess that a character may come from. This isn't necessarily their place of birth, it could be where they grew up, studied, trained, worked, or otherwise spent a meaningful amount of time. You may roll 1d100 on the appropriate column or choose a region from the below table to determine your character's background region. If there is one, you may learn the noted Extra Language. Since the Rhennee are nomadic and rarely stay in any one place for long, Rhennee characters can still roll for or pick a region if they wish, but instead of any Extra Language that might be listed, they may learn Rhopan.

Only Rhennee characters may learn this language.","title":"Languages"},{"location":"character-creation/#background-regions","text":"There are many distinct regions of the Flanaess that a character may come from. This isn't necessarily their place of birth, it could be where they grew up, studied, trained, worked, or otherwise spent a meaningful amount of time. You may roll 1d100 on the appropriate column or choose a region from the below table to determine your character's background region. If there is one, you may learn the noted Extra Language. Since the Rhennee are nomadic and rarely stay in any one place for long, Rhennee characters can still roll for or pick a region if they wish, but instead of any Extra Language that might be listed, they may learn Rhopan.
